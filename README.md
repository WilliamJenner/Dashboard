# Dashboard 
Front end for the house wallboard.

# Development
Before development, you'll want to download the house [API](https://github.com/WilliamJenner/HouseAPI).
The app is set up to use the real house api in development, but you may want to change some settings.

1. Install the node_modules folder 
    * ``npm install``
2. Running the app
    * Development 
        * `npm run dev:server`
    * Use Electron 
        * `npm run dev:electron`
    * Production 
        * `npm run prod`
3. Run the application through IIS
# Roadmap
- Add HMR so the dev doesn't need to reload
